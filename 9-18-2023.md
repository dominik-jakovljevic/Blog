# Network Fundamentals Day 1

For my first day in the blog I will be starting with learning Networking Fundamentals using TryhackMe. My goal is to brush up on my knowledge of networking and to begin working towards obtaining the CompTIA Network + Certificate. Here we go :point_down:

What is a ***network***? A network is a group of devices that are interconnected with each other to allow for communication.

What is the **internet**? The internet is a massive singular network that is comprised of small networks working together. The small networks making up the internet is what we call **private networks** while the networks that connect all of these private networks are called **public networks**.

All devices have two main ways of getting identified on a network:
1. Your **IP Address** (Internet Protocol)
2. Your **MAC Address** (Media Access Control Address)

The IP Address is a chain of numbers that are divided into **four octets**. Each of the numbers of the octets are calculated using something called **IP addressing** and **subnetting**.

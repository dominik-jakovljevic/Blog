# Network Fundamentals Day 1

For my first day in the blog I will be starting with learning Networking Fundamentals using TryhackMe. My goal is to brush up on my knowledge of networking and to begin working towards obtaining the CompTIA Network + Certificate. Here we go :point_down:

What is a ***network***? A network is a group of devices that are interconnected with each other to allow for communication.

What is the ***internet***? The internet is a massive singular network that is comprised of small networks working together. The small networks making up the internet is what we call ***private networks*** while the networks that connect all of these private networks are called ***public networks***. 

All devices have two main ways of getting identified on a network:
1. Your ***IP Address*** (Internet Protocol)
2. Your ***MAC Address*** (Media Access Control Address)

The IP Address is a chain of numbers that are divided into ***four octets***. Each of the numbers of the octets are calculated using something called ***IP addressing*** and ***subnetting***. The IP address of a device can change but there cannot be duplicate IP addresses in the same network. 

IP addresses follow certain ***protocols*** that allow devices to communicate among one another. Devices can have private and public IP addresses. A public IP address is what we use to find the device on the internet while a private address is used to find a device in a pool of other devices.

# Network Fundamentals Day 1

For my first day in the blog I will be starting with learning Networking Fundamentals using TryhackMe. My goal is to brush up on my knowledge of networking and to begin working towards obtaining the CompTIA Network + Certificate.

What is a **network**? A network is a group of devices that are interconnected with each other to allow for communication.

What is the **internet**? The internet is a massive singular network that is comprised of small networks working together.

## Ping

What is ***Ping***? Ping is an essential networking tool that security professionals rely on to determine if the connection between devices exists or is reliable. Ping does this using the ***Internet Control Message Protocol*** (ICMP). Ping calculates the connection speed between devices by tracking how long it takes for ICMP packets to travel for one device to another. The calculations are done using ICMP's echo packet and echo reply from the device.

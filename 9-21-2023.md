# Network Fundamentals Day 2

## Ping

What is ***Ping***? Ping is an essential networking tool that security professionals rely on to determine if the connection between devices exists or is reliable. Ping does this using the ***Internet Control Message Protocol*** (ICMP). Ping calculates the connection speed between devices by tracking how long it takes for ICMP packets to travel for one device to another. The calculations are done using ICMP's echo packet and echo reply from the device. 

You can ping pretty much everything that is connected to a network such as different websites or even your own network at home. 

The proper syntax in order to use the ping tool is:

    ping IP address 

And if you don't know the IP address:

    ping website url

What is ***network topology***? Network topology is quite literally the way that the network is designed and how it looks.

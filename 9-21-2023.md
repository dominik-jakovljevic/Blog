# Network Fundamentals Day 2

## Ping

What is ***Ping***? Ping is an essential networking tool that security professionals rely on to determine if the connection between devices exists or is reliable. Ping does this using the ***Internet Control Message Protocol*** (ICMP). Ping calculates the connection speed between devices by tracking how long it takes for ICMP packets to travel for one device to another. The calculations are done using ICMP's echo packet and echo reply from the device. 

You can ping pretty much everything that is connected to a network such as different websites or even your own network at home. 

The proper syntax in order to use the ping tool is:

    ping IP address 

And if you don't know the IP address:

    ping website url

## Introduction to LAN

What is ***network topology***? Network topology is quite literally the way that the network is designed and how it looks. 

Types of network topologies:

1. ***Ring topology***: this is where all the devices on a network such as computers are connected by cable to form a loop. Data in this type of topology is sent until it reaches the device it was meant for. Since the data travels all in one direction and in an continoued loop, it is pretty easy to find any bugs that might arise. But also since the topology depends on the other devices in the network to relay data, if anything happens to the cable or devices the entire network will break making it obsolete. 

2. ***Bus topology***: this is where all the devices on a network are connected by a single cable called the ***backbone cable***. Since all of the devices are connected and branch out (like leaves on a tree) from a single cable, the data quickly becomes slow to reach the desination devices (this is what we call ***bottlenecking***). When a bottleneck occurs, it becomes hard to troubleshoot where the problem is coming from since all the data is traveling along the same route. One positive about this topology is that it is easier to set up than the others and usually cheaper to set up. Much like the Ring topology, if anything happens to the backbone cable, the entire network will break. 

3. ***Star topology***:

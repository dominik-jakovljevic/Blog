What is the ***ARP Protocol***? The ARP Protocol also known as the Address Resolution Protocol, is the protocol that gives devices the ability to identify themselves on a network. In other words, it lets the devices to associate its own MAC address with an IP address inside of the network. All the other devices on the network will keep track of what MAC addresses belong to what devices. Devices use the ARP protocol to find other devices on a network. 

Every single device on a network has a place to store data also known as a ***cache***. This cache will store the different identifiers of all the other devices in the network. The two identifiers that have to be stored are of course the IP addresses and MAC addresses of all the devices. The ARP protocol sends two types of requests in order to identify the two. It sends a ***ARP Request*** and an ***ARP Reply***. 

When the ARP Request is sent out, it messages all the other devices and asks them if devices MAC address matches the IP address that was requested. When the device with the requested IP address is found, an ARP Reply comes back to the original device. 

What is the ***DHCP Protocol***? There are two ways that a device can obtain an IP address, one way is by manually entering them into the device and the other way is by using a DHCP server or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server. Whenever a devices enters a network if it hasn't obtained an IP address yet, it sends out request or ***DHCP Discover*** to find out if there are DHCP servers in the network. Next the DHCP server reponds with an IP address for the device or what we call ***DHCP Offer***. When the device gets this, it sends out a confirmation that it wants the IP address (***DHCP Request***). Finally the server tells the device that the IP address can be used (***DHCP ACK***).

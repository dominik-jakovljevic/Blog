# Network Plus Study Day 2

## WAN Termination

### Demarcation Point

The ***demarcation point*** is the single point(s) where you can connect to the outside world

Some examples of these types of points are:

- WAN Provider
- Internet Service Provider
- The demarc

These demarcation points are used everywhere even in homes. The point serves as a central location in a building usually done so by a network interface device

You connect your CPE (customer premises equipment) to the demarcation point

### Smartjack

The ***smartjack*** is an example of a Network Interface unit (NIU). This is the device that determines the demarc

The smartjack is more than just a simple interface, it can be a circuit card in a chassis

Smartjacks have built in diagnostics by the network providers that also provide loopback tests

# Network Fundamentals Day 5

## Port Forwarding

What is ***port forwarding***? Port forwarding is what's responsible for connection services and applications on your network to the Internet. If port forwarding didn't exist, all of the services and networks would only work in one network instead of the whole internet. Port forwarding opens specific ports which enables the data to flow through multiple networks instead of one.

The device that is used to enable port forwarding is the router.

# Network Fundamentals Day 5

## Port Forwarding

What is ***port forwarding***? Port forwarding is what's responsible for connection services and applications on your network to the Internet. If port forwarding didn't exist, all of the services and networks would only work in one network instead of the whole internet. Port forwarding opens specific ports which enables the data to flow through multiple networks instead of one.

The device that is used to enable port forwarding is the router.

## Firewalls

What is a ***firewall***? A firewall is a device than can be found in a network and its job is to determine what sort of traffic will be allowed to enter or exit.  A network administrator can set the firewall to ***permit*** or ***deny*** traffic entering or exiting the networking depending on certain factors. 

The factors are: :point_down|

* Origin of the traffic (the firewall could be directed to accept or deny traffic coming from certain networks)
* The destination of the traffic (the firewall could be directed to accept or deny traffic going to a certain network)
* Which port is the traffic for 
* The protocol that the traffic is using

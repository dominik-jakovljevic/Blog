# We're Back - Network Plus Study Day 1

## OSI Model Walkthrough

What does the ***OSI Model stand for?*** It stands for Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model

The ***OSI Model*** is a model or guide, it's not a law in the world of computing

When the ***OSI Model*** was first concieved, they wanted to implement the OSI protocol suite. But instead they went for TCP / IP

For every layer in the ***OSI Model***, there are sets of protocols that are used to make sure that the layers are operational

A common acronym for the ***OSI Model*** is: All people seem to need data processing 

## Layer 1 (Physical Layer) of the OSI Model

***Layer 1*** of the OSI Model is called the ***physical layer***

This layer is where we can find all of the cables, connectors, and signaling. One thing that this layer isn't about is about protocols. 

When there is a problem on the ***physical layer*** it means that the cabling should be fixed, loopback tests should be ran, and swap adapter cards

## Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI Model

***Layer 2*** of the OSI Model is called the ***Data Link layer***

We can find the foundation of the communication at this layer

The protocols that run at ***layer 2*** are called Data Link Control (DLC) protocols and they include:

- MAC (Media Access Control) address on Ethernet

Sometimes we call ***layer 2*** the switching layer

## Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI Model

***Layer 3*** of the OSI Model is called the ***network layer*** or even the routing layer

This is the layer that works with IP (internet protocol)
addresses

Frames are fragmented (broken into smaller pieces)
at ***layer 3***

## Layer 4 (Transport) of the OSI Model

***Layer 4*** of the OSI Model is called the ***transport layer*** 

Sometimes we called ***layer 4*** the post office layer because it determines how and where the data will be delivered 

The protocols that are used at ***layer 4*** include:

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

## Layer 5 (Session) of the OSI Model

***Layer 5*** of the OSI Model is called the ***session layer***

This is where communication management between devices happens such as start, stop, and restart

## Layer 6 (Presentation) of the OSI Model

***Layer 6*** of the OSI model is called the ***presentation layer***

***Layer 6*** is where character encoding and application encryption take place 

This layer is often combined with layer 7 so we can actually use the applications 

## Layer 7 (Application) of the OSI Model

***Layer 7*** of the OSI model is called the ***application layer***

This layer is what we see on our computers. For example the google page runs on ***layer 7***

## Example

An example of all of these layers in action is when we used an application such as Gmail:

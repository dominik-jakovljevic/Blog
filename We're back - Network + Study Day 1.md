# We're Back - Network Plus Study Day 1

## OSI Model Walkthrough

What does the ***OSI Model stand for?*** It stands for Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model

The ***OSI Model*** is a model or guide, it's not a law in the world of computing

When the ***OSI Model*** was first concieved, they wanted to implement the OSI protocol suite. But instead they went for TCP / IP

For every layer in the ***OSI Model***, there are sets of protocols that are used to make sure that the layers are operational

A common acronym for the ***OSI Model*** is: All people seem to need data processing 

## Layer 1 (Physical Layer) of the OSI Model

***Layer 1*** of the OSI Model is called the ***physical layer***

This layer is where we can find all of the cables, connectors, and signaling. One thing that this layer isn't about is about protocols. 

When there is a problem on the ***physical layer*** it means that the cabling should be fixed, loopback tests should be ran, and swap adapter cards
